It was a project to get familiarize with gRPC streams and scyllaDB.Apex takes two config --flag. For example:

If the gRPC server is not running on localhost:8080 you can change it with
	apex --addr localhost:8080

You can change the concurrency with 
	apex --workerCount 6
Higher workerCount means higher concurrency
The default value is 6.`,
