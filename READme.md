It is using golang's <em>concurrency primitives</em> for multi-upload, gRPC stream to uplaod <em>chunck-data of blob</em> to server and stores the uploaded files in <b>ScyllaDB</b>, which is a <em>distributed real-time big-data Database</em>.

## Installation

```bash

ðŸš€ apex
Apex searchs all file/s in the input directory to concurrently upload them to scyllaDB.
It was a project to get familiarize with gRPC streams and scyllaDB.Apex takes two config --flag. For example:

If the apex server is not running on localhost:1500 you can change it with
        apex --addr localhost:8080

You can change the concurrency with
        apex --workerCount 6
Higher workerCount means higher concurrency
The default value is 6.

Usage:
  apex [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  upload      uplaods all file/s concurrently to scyllaDB
